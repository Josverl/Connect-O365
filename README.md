# Connect-O365
   Connect to Office 365 and most related services and get ready to admin with Powershell.

I created this script because I foudn it too confusing to remember the different options and installation methods to prepare a workstaion to connect to and administer office 365 services.

What initially started as a few lines, has grown over time to a script that is quite usefull, especially in combination with the ability of powershell 5 ( and earlier versions) to easily add ans update scripts via the Powershell gallery.

The main use cases are :  

* Connect to multiple Office 365 services without the need to re-enter your credentials multiple times. 
* Close speccific connections ( -Close) 
* Install all relevant components and modules ( -Install)
* Tests the installed Modules ( -Test)
