NUGET PowerShell Scripts
When a package carries an install.ps1 file within its \tools folder, 
the script will be run after package installation. An uninstall.ps1 is executed before uninstallation. Lastly, init.ps1 is executed every time the solution is opened (assuming the NuGet PowerShell Console is open). Target framework filters apply to this folder too.
